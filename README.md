# <u>gpe</u>
A C++ codebase for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two dimensions.

## <u>To-do list for this repo</u>:
This will continually be updated with things to do to get the main codebase up and running.

### Grids
- [x] Set up 1d positional and k-space grids.
- [x] Construct meshgrid function.
- [x] Construct fftshift function.

### Wavefunction
- [ ] Set up initial state algorithm (un-trapped/uniform density).
- [ ] Set up useful routines (normalisation etc.).

### Symplectic Routine
- [ ] Set up kinetic energy evolution.
- [ ] Set up potential energy evolution.

### Data
- [ ] Set up HDF5 to save data.
